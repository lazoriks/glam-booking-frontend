// This is a basic Tailwind CSS configuration file that specifies the content paths
// where Tailwind should look for class names to generate styles. It also extends
// the default theme, allowing for custom styles to be added later. The plugins array
// is currently empty, but can be used to include additional Tailwind CSS plugins in the future.
